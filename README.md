# SmallPack

## About

A small modpack for the YouTuber SmallHat.

It does not have a lot of mods nor a questline, so it might be one of the worst modpack expierences.
Have fun playing it anyways.

## Goals

The end game goal is to have the Creative Vending Upgrade from the Storage Drawers mod.

## Play

To play this modpack, you need MultiMC.
Download the modpacks code as a ZIP file and import it into MultiMC as a ZIP-File.
